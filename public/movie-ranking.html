<h3>KGF movie series (1 & 2)</h3>
<p>The kgf movie series describes about a character in ancient india after independence.
The name of the character is rocky who decided to become the richest person on the earth as 
promised to his mother. His dedication towards his journey against all the odds makes it so interesting.</p>
<h3>Salaar</h3>
